%   Input:
%
%   X0      Noise free data of of size Nobs x Nvar
%   s2c_a   Variance of the additive correlated noise (scalar) 
%   s2u_a   Variance of the additive UNcorrelated noise (1 x Nvar vector)
%   s2c_m   Variance of the Multiplicative correlated noise (scalar) 
%   s2u_m   Variance of the Multiplivative UNcorrelated noise (1 x Nvar vector)
%
%   Output:
%
%   X       X0 with Multiplicative correlated and uncorrelated error added
%
%   Usage example:
%   
%   Generate error free data:
%   Nvar = 10;
%   Nobs = 100;
%   Mean = zeros(1,Nvar);
%   Sigma = eye(Nvar);
%   X = mvrand(Mean, Sigma,Nobs);
%    
%   Specify error vaiances:
%
%   Variance of the Adittive correlated component 
%   s2c_a = 0.5;
% 
%   Variance(s) of the Additive uncorrelated error (here the same for all variables)
%   s2u_a = 0.5*ones(1,Nvar);
%
%   Variance of the correlated  Multiplicative component
%   s2c_m = 0.5;
% 
%   Variance(s) of the uncorrelated Multiplicative component (here the same for all variables)
%   s2u_m = 0.5*ones(1,Nvar);
%
%   X  = GenData_AdditiveMultiplicativeNoise(X0,s2c_a,s2u_a,s2c_m,s2u_m)
